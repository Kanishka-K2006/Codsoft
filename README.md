Features:

->Random number generation between 1 and 100

->User gets 5 attempts

->Hints provided:

  *Too high

  *Too low

->Displays remaining attempts

->Shows the correct number if the user loses

Technologies Used:

->Java

->Scanner class for user input

->Math.random() for number generation


Task 3 -Currency Converter (Java)
